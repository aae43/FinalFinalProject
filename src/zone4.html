          <h1 class="card-title">Zone 4 - Extreme Privacy</h1>

          <p>
            Zone 4 is compromised of steps that are meant to absolutely remove your existence from the web
            so that if anyone tried to they wouldn't be able to. This is meant for people who are litterally
            trying to disappear off the grid. Not many people will go this far, but if need be, the
            instructions are here.
          </p>

          <H4>Phone Usage</H4>
          1. Either no phone or basic flip phone with NO texts, only calls<br>
          2. Try to use burner phones and try to change them as often as you can/need
          <br><br>
          <h4>Social Engineering</h4>
          1. DO NOT talk to strangers online or in real life<br>
          2. Never give people your real information<br>
          3. Have multiple aliases available off the top of your head to answer with if asked<br>
          4. Change your speech patters so that no one will be able to identify you
          <br><br>
          <h4>Erasing Your Identity</h4>
          1. Fill emails with mail bombers which make it almost impossible to find any information from your
          email<br>
          2. Upload pictures of random people on all your accounts to make it harder for people to find out
          who the account belongs to<br>
          3. Change all the information on your accounts (names, address, number, date of birth, previous
          jobs, relatives, etc.) so that nothing matches or links back to you<br>
          4. Every account should br completely different with all different information<br>
          5. Remove links between accounts so that nothing links back to you<br>
          6. Make your online identity and your real life identity COMPLETELY different<br>
          7. Delete as many accounts as possible

              1. In 1995 just 1% of the world had internet access. Today, that number has skyrocketed to 57%,
              with over 4 billion internet users worldwide.<br><br>
              2. Even though privacy laws are a relatively recent legal development, over 80 countries around
              the world have enacted some type of privacy law.<br><br>
              3. In the U.S., all 50 states as well as Washington D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico and all the U.S.
              Virgin Islands, have enacted laws that require businesses to notify consumers if their personal
              information is compromised.

          <h1 class="card-title">Zone 3 - Drastic Privacy</h1>

          <p>
            Zone 3 is compromised of steps that are more advanced and not everyone will do these steps.
            These are geared to more tech savvy people or people who have something to hide and want to mask
            as much of their identity as possible.

          <H4>Computer Operating System</H4>
          1. Order of LEAST to MOST secure
          <ul>
            <li>Windows</li>
            <li>Mac OS</li>
            <li>Linux being run on Mac or Windows</li>
            <li>Linux Host</li>
          </ul>
          2. Linux is almost never targeted because of how secure it is<br>
          3. Password protect your BIOS and hard drive<br>
          4. Ditch Google completely! Yes that includes Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc.<br>
          5. Ditch ALL Social media<br>
          6. Use Tor as your web browser because it is the most secure (very similar to firefox)<br>
          * Use encrypted traffic and hidden IP on Tor *
          <br><br>
          <h4>Smartphone</h4>
          1. Either a basic flip phone or an android with privacy custom ROM installed and more importanly
          without any of the google services on it<br>
          2. Location and bluetooth should always be off<br>
          3. Do not text on flip phone because it does not have capability fr encrypted messages<br>
          4. You can text on android but on signal
          <br><br>
          <h4>Spending Money</h4>
          1. Buy prepaid debit cards with cash so there is no trace back to you<br>
          2. If you absolutely have to buy something online, link your prepaid card to a name and address that
          isn't yours so nothing is traced back to you. Also, use Tor to minimize traffic when buying
          online<br>
          3. Another option that is becoming more popular is cryptocurrency, but not all sites accept that as
          a method of payment

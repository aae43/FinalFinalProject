          <h1 class="card-title">Zone 2 - More Complex Privacy</h1>

          <p>
            Zone 2 is compromised of steps that are still very doable yet and protect you more than zone 1.
            These steps are a little more advances and require more work and detachment from accessibility.

          1. Texting is insecure, use iMessage for iPhone or Signal for Android. Signal is open source and
          offers end to end encryption which keeps you secure<br>
          2. Email services are also insecure. Proton mail is and open source program that offers end to end
          encryption as well. It is a little annoying to transfer emails, but it is a one time thing and you
          wont have to do it again
          <br><br>
          <h4>Smartphones</h4>
          1. iPhone is more secure than android out of the box (without any of the permissions we blindly
          agree to when setting up a phone)<br>
          2. Android is more secure if you are tech savvy and want to make custom security on your device<br>
          3. DO NOT use any face ID or fingerprint as a password. The traditional password is the most secure
          <br><br>
          <h4>Storage</h4>
          1. Always wipe your hard drive every month or so<br>
          2. Use C-Cleaner to make sure your hard drives are clean and secure
          <br><br>
          <h4>Router</h4>
          1. DO NOT use default password on router<br>
          2. Hide SSID so you can't see the wifi when you look for it, but you have to input it manually which
          is more work but a lot more secure
          <br><br>
          <h4>Browser</h4>
          1. Avoid Google Chrome or any chromium-based browser<br>
          2. Use Firefox or any secure browser<br>
          3. Use u-block origen<br>
          4. Make sure flash and java script are disabled

              <h5>Data Privacy Statistics:</h5><br>
              1. Of consumers who had experienced an online security incident, such as an account hack, data
              breach or a stolen password, 27% estimated that the incident ended up costing them $100 to
              $10,000 or more.<br><br>
              2. In 2018, there were a whopping 1.244 billion data breaches in the U.S., leading to over 446
              million records exposed.<br><br>
              3. According to Corodata, 46% of U.S. firms suffered a data breach in 2018 â€“ a nearly twofold
              increase over 2017.
